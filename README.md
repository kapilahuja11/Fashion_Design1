# Fashion_MNIST

In this notebook, we build a simple convoluation neural network using tensorflow to classify Fashion-MNIST dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/zalando-research/fashionmnist), which is a dataset of Zalando's article images. Fashion-MNIST serves as a direct drop-in replacement for the original MNIST dataset for benchmarking machine learning algorithms

The training set consists of 60k examples and test set consists of 10k examples. Each example is a 28x28 grayscale image, associated with a label from 10 classes as mentioned below.
